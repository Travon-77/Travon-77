## A Few Things About Me  
I’m a big fan of spontaneous adventures, deep conversations, and getting lost in museums.
I’m all about cozy café vibes, National Geographic documentaries, and late-night curiosity rabbit holes.
Add in a good playlist, a scenic walk, and a random fun fact — and I’m in my element.
